    # payment_id from SQL implies one-to-one or one-to-many.
    # If one EMI can have multiple payments (e.g., partial payments), this needs to be a ManyToMany or a reverse relation.
    # If one EMI is paid by one payment, it's OneToOne.
    # The SQL `emi` table has `payment_id` and `payments` table has `emi_id`. This is a circular dependency.
    # I will assume `payment_id` in `emi` refers to the *final* payment that marked it paid, or the *first* payment.
    # For simplicity and to break the circular dependency, I will remove `payment_id` from EMI and
    # let the `Payment` model have a ForeignKey to `EMI`.
    # If an EMI needs to track *which* payment paid it, we can add a OneToOneField or a ForeignKey here.
    # For now, `payments_made` reverse relation from Payment will suffice.
    # If `payment_id` in EMI means the ID of the payment that *completed* this EMI, then it should be null=True.
    # Given the SQL `payment_id integer(10) NOT NULL` in `emi` and `emi_id integer(10) NOT NULL` in `payments`,
    # this suggests a payment *belongs* to an EMI, and an EMI *has* a payment.
    # This is best modeled as a OneToOneField from EMI to Payment if an EMI is paid by exactly one payment,
    # or a ForeignKey from Payment to EMI if one EMI can have multiple payments.
    # I will stick to the ForeignKey from Payment to EMI and remove `payment_id` from EMI,
    # as it's the more common and flexible approach.
    # If the user insists on `payment_id` in EMI, it would require careful handling of circular dependencies.
    # Let's assume `payment_id` in `emi` from the SQL refers to the `Payment` that *settled* this EMI.
    # This would make it a OneToOneField or a ForeignKey with `null=True`.
    # To resolve the circular dependency, I'll make it a ForeignKey with `null=True, blank=True`.
